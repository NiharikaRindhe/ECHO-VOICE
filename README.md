I bought an Android Head Unit (Ainavi H6/AliExpress) for my Toyta Auris, as the factory Head Unit was very limited.

The Ainavi H6 Head Unit works fine, but it ships with a version of Google Assistant that is not very multilingual.
When asking it to navigate to a specific addresse, it does not recognize the addresse when spoken in Finnish or Swedish.
It is also tied to the System Language (which I prefer to be English).

As a workaround I coded a custom Android App for controlling things via speech that uses Google SpeechRecognizer, 
hence it supports more languages then the pre-installed version of the Google Assistant and is not limited to
the Android System Language.

## Known Issues
- The App works well when the background noise level is low, however speech recognition **is not very accurate** when there's loads of background noise (AC, driving with high speed etc).
