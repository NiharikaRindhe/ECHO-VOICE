# Voice Commands
I bought an Android Head Unit (Ainavi H6/AliExpress) for my Toyta Auris, as the factory Head Unit was very limited.

The Android Head Unit works fine, but it has one flaw - Google Assistant does support the Finnish language, making 
voice recognition for navigational purposes useless at least here in Finland.

As a workaround I coded a custom Android App for controlling things via speech that uses Google SpeechRecognizer, hence it supports more languages.

## Known Issues
- The App works well when the background noise level is low, however speech recognition **is not very accurate** when there's loads of background noise (AC, driving with high speed etc).
