## WhatsApp contacts list missing when "Companion device"
- It seems WhatsApp contacts will not be stored locally, unless the device is registered 
as a "master" device
- Workaround is to **register your account** in the Headset unit, so 
**NOT add it as a "Companion" device**
- When you register it, all your other devices will logout
- After registering in the Head Unit, you can go back and add it as a Companion device again
